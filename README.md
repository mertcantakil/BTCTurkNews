# BtcTurk PRO

BTCTurk Pro consists of 3 screens:

The main page listing news sources,
A list page listing news from a selected source, and
Detail pages for each selected news item.
Filtering can be done by categories. When you navigate to the detail page of a news source, you can access the English news published by that source. The slider section on the page displays the latest news and automatically changes every 5 seconds. The page refreshes every 30 seconds. Additionally, you can add desired news to your reading list. If you want to read a news article in more detail, you can click on the title or the image of the related news to access its details. API details can be found at https://newsapi.org.
